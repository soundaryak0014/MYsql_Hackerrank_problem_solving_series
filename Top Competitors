-- Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, 
-- and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! 
-- Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers 
-- who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. 
-- Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges 
-- in which the hacker earned a full score. 
-- If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, 
-- then sort them by ascending hacker_id.
